## Overview
* The lab will look at doubling using the Adapter Design Pattern. Please refer to week six lecture on the Adapter Design Pattern. 
* This lab will an adapter for calls to the file system, adapters for input from the console and output to the console.
* Please find a video overview of what you need to know from the Adapter Design Pattern lecture for the lab [https://uofglasgow.zoom.us/rec/share/QjQt1zbjuwQGYgMrX1tDDBc-PUqa_CpvxJGI0gV1gvEStOTcGnn55ls_TQVRVbfD.N9qsbYv71kE0iBtJ?startTime=1644928799000](https://uofglasgow.zoom.us/rec/share/QjQt1zbjuwQGYgMrX1tDDBc-PUqa_CpvxJGI0gV1gvEStOTcGnn55ls_TQVRVbfD.N9qsbYv71kE0iBtJ?startTime=1644928799000).

* If you are interested in pair programming, it is optional, see [video](https://uofglasgow.zoom.us/rec/share/QjQt1zbjuwQGYgMrX1tDDBc-PUqa_CpvxJGI0gV1gvEStOTcGnn55ls_TQVRVbfD.N9qsbYv71kE0iBtJ?startTime=1644928799000) and [wiki](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/DerekSomerville/javagetstarted/-/wikis/home/Pair-Programming) and register on the [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=KVxybjp2UE-B8i4lTwEzyELpM2ZClsRNrJBn7A_b41VUMlFPTUpPMjlCSkRQQTE5NUpYQ01INUJLSy4u)

## Adapter classes Names
The below is guidance for you to create and amend the classes. We have not created these in advance for you.
* Input interface name input in the Console package
* Output interface name output in the Console package
* Input adapter name InputTestAdapter in the Console package
* Output adapter name OutputTestAdapter in the Console package
* Load config interface name Config in the Structure Package
* Load config adapter LoadTestAdapter in the Structure Package

## Game.CardGame Tests
* Create a test for getComputerPlayersNames, create an adapter for LoadConfig, note there is CardGame.setLoadConfig.
  * Moderate - Test name getComputerPlayersNamesAdapter you can get a list of at least three names. Use different names to the playersNames.cfg
* Create two tests for createComputerPlayers
  * Easy after previous - Test name createComputerPlayersAdapter for a list of three names and check the name of the third computer player is correct
  * Easy - Test name createComputerPlayersSizeAdapter to see three players have been created. Not you pass four as the noOfPlayers to create three players, it assumes a human player is created.
* Create a test for createHumanPlayerAdapter
  * Easy - Test name createHumanPlayer, check the name of the human player
* Create a test for initiatePlayersAdapter
  * Easy - Test name initiatePlayers, check the number of players created
* Create a test for initiateAdapter
  * Easy - Test name initiate, check at least one player has been dealt cards
* Create a test for playAdapter
  * Moderate - Test name play, think about the play while condition, try to run the game end to end

## Game.BlackJack
* Create a test for "play", so an end to end test using the adpaters
  * Advanced - Test name is "playAdapter", check if the game has finished and the user has three cards

## Game.Sevens
* Create a test for "play", so an end to end test using the adpaters
  * Advanced - Test name is "playAdapter", check if the game has finished and the user has no cards. Note you can override the deck and don't need to use a full pack
  
## Submit
* Before you commit your final solution, double check it can build and all the test you completed can run.
* Go to the Week 7 section and open the assessment
* In text paste the https .git for the forked project
* Zip the project and submit
